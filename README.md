# Impact of the Exam Weeks on Regular Physical Activity and Calories Burned

## Motivation and Aim
As an university student, life during exam weeks makes us feel fatigue and inactive with long hours of studying and limited time for physical activity. In this project we aim to explore whether my daily step count and calorie expenditure are significantly impacted during exam periods compared to regular days. By analyzing this data, we hope to gain insights into how exams influence my physical mobility and identify ways to better balance academics and well-being activities.  

## Methods and Implementation
### Data Collection:
I will allocate daily step count and calorie data from the Health application on my iPhone. Addition to that, I will provide a detailed exam calendar for the analysis.
### Data Processing:
The data will be set apart into two categories: Exam Week and Regular Time. Steps and calorie data during exam weeks will be isolated for comparison with the rest of the dataset.
### Analyzing by Python language
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to identify patterns and trends. Statistical methods and visualizations will be used to compare physical activity and calorie expenditure between the two periods.
### Visualization
Time-series plots, bar charts, and comparative visuals will be used to outline differences and draw comprehensive conclusions.

## Expected Output
A clear and compelling comparison of physical activity and calorie expenditure during exam weeks versus regular days. Statistics to validate the hypothesis that physical activity decreases during exam periods. Insightful visualizations that represents the findings effectively and clearly.

## Data Allocation
Steps and Calories: Daily step count and calorie data sourced from the Health application on my personal iPhone.
Exam Calendar: A detailed schedule of exam dates to identify and mark the exam weeks in the dataset.
